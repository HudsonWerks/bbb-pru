This is a simple program to help you get started with programming the AM335x PRU_ICSS on the BeagleBone Black.

The code is primarily based on code from Douglas G. Henke with lengthier explanation at http://mythopoeic.org/bbb-pru-minimal.

1) To build, just type "make." This assumes you have several conditions set:

  a. pasm Assembly tool in $PATH
  b. prussdrv library headers (pruss_intc_mapping.h and prussdrv.h) in path /usr/include/ 
  c. and the prussdrv libraries in /usr/lib/

2) As root user, enable the PRU:

   # echo BB-BONE-PRU-01 >/sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots

3) Run the compiled file as root (include the "sudo"):

   # sudo ./example

If it's working correctly, you should see the following output:

  waiting for interrupt from PRU0...
  Major Tom's Test PRU program completed, event number 1

It should take ~5 seconds between the first line and the second. You can modify the duration in the "example.p" file. The event number will increase each time you run it.
